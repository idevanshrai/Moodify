# Moodify

This project demonstrates how to create a web-based application that generates a personalized Spotify playlist based on the user's mood and the time of day. The application uses a slider-based questionnaire to assess user mood and provides a curated playlist that enhances the listening experience.

## Key Features:

- **Mood Assessment:** Users can select their mood using an intuitive slider interface.
- **Curated Playlists:** Each mood selection generates a customized playlist from Spotify.
- **User-friendly Interface:** Simple and engaging design for an enjoyable user experience.

## Components Required:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Spotify API
